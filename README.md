# simpan.in - React Native Bookmark Manager

IMPORTANT: simpan.in is a UI Kit built with React Native and is based on [Simpanin Bookmark Manager App Ui Kit](https://ui8.net/smplsprfct/products/simpanin-bookmark-manager-app-ui-kit) to figma, so any figma file will be shared, if need the figma file feel free to buy from the author.

## Purpose

My purpose with this project is learn and improve my skills as a developer and at the same time build something cool that can be used to help other developers start their own projects.

So feel free to fork it and use it for your own purpose.

This is the first of other UI Kits that I pretend to built using some cool technology like React Native, SwiftUI, Flutter and any other.

## Features

Basically I pretend to built a completely functional app, this include UI, integration with some service like Firebase or Supabase (thinking about...) and CI/CD.
